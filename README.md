# idealab-whiteboard

This is a collaborative white board for Idealab Students on the Macalester Idealab website. It is entirely created from the code at https://github.com/cracker0dks/whiteboard and we give huge thanks to the contributors that created that project.

The reason the project was cloned to this repo was to alter the look of the whiteboard and for running it on heroku.
